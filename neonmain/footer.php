                    <p style="text-align: center;">There once was a stock that put to sea

The name of the stock was $GME

The price blew up, the shorts dipped down

Hold my bully boys hold



Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go



She had not been two weeks from shore

When Ryan Cohen joined the board

The captain called all hands and swore

He'll take his shares and hold



Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go



Before the news had hit the market

Wall Street Bets came up and bought it

with diamond hands they knew they'd profit

if they could only hold



Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go



No deals were cut, no shorts were squeezed

The captain's mind was not on greed

But he belonged to the autist's creed

He took the risk to hold



Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go



For forty days or even more

the stock went up then down once more

All gains were lost, it was looking poor

but still those traders did hold



Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go



As far as I've heard the fights still on

the shorts not squeezed and the gains not won

The tendieman makes his regular call

to encourage the captain, crew and all



Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go



Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go</p>
